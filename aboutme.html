                <p id="about_meee">  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hi! I am <strong>Lady Lyne Rivera Manalang</strong>, student in grade 12. I started studying programming in September 2022, and I intend to continue it <em>with the help of Sir Louie Almeda,</em> a software engineer.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had no idea before about programming, and I did not see myself in this matter because I think low of myself, that's why I accept that I'm only up for productions and simple jobs. Because I don't take my schooling seriously, my only reason is to go to high school. But through programming, my life's dream is gradually expanding.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It get to the point that my head hurts when I don't understand what I'm doing but when I solve it, I feel very relieved.
                    It's not easy for me to sleep when I have a problem that cannot be solved.
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my weaknesses is understanding the English language and communicating. So I lose hope. But little by little, I am building confidence in myself that one day I will overcome my weaknesses. I can't believe that at the age of 18, I can learn programming. So I am very grateful that this opportunity came to me.</p>

            <p class="captions"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Louie's first challenge to me almost took me a few weeks. <br>It feels good when you move something, I almost couldn't sleep when I was doing it, the fish multiplied, but their movements were not random when the mouse disappeared.<br> And maybe they are full so they don't want to eat the food hahaha I'm just kidding.</p>

            <p class="captions">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was annoyed when I was doing this because I always lost what I had done..
                I first drew on paper how I would do it, then I placed blocks using the image of khanAcademy. It's okay, maybe the computation was wrong, so the movement of the ball on the blocks is not correct. Then I don't know which is the right way I did HAHAHA</p>

            <p class="captions">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still need to know how to make the blocks disappear when hit by the ball. But who would have thought that I used to play it and now I am planning how that game works.</p>

            <p id="my-experience"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For me, it's a big challenge. As a result, I became  focused on my laptop that I almost didn't want to put it down until I could move something. JavaScript gives me headaches, that much I can say. I discover at this stage for the first time that I was programming while I slept. You had already solved the issue previous to the dream. Maybe someone with a low understanding of learning, like myself, will struggle greatly in this situation. Despite everything, I eventually realized how things functioned. Not at all, considering how confused I remain today. The headache is still present. But if I compare then I really don't know what programming is doing.</p>
